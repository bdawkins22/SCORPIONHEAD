S C O R P I O N H E A D is an interactive cyberpoem that explores queerness through digital abstraction. Written in Python and intended to run in the Mac Terminal, the cyberpoem presents a questioning speaker struggling to exist in a system designed to suppress bugs or abnormalities. As the program destabilizes and their sense of self fragments, the speaker embraces the fact that their identity cannot be easily labeled, and reforms themselves amid the ruins of the machine.
